# Planes: the Game

Planes is a game that allows for two players, on one keyboard, to feel the riveting action of an in-air dogfight between two modern fighter planes. Beyond the gameplay, it is a demonstration of
Python knowledge, created by Carter Peck. All graphics are taken from Canva and must be installed as well to play the game.

## Setup

Playing the game begins with these steps.

1) Copy the SSH from the Code dropdown on the main GitHub page.
2) Paste ```git clone [ssh]``` into the terminal while in an empty directory.
3) Open the file after running the command.
4) Play using your favorite text editor's code runner.

## How to play:

Playing is very easy, but controls depend on which side you're on.

**Left side (Blue)**

You will play with the ```control keys``` and ```right control``` button to fire. ```Up, Down, Left, and Right``` control your movement.


**Right side (Red)**

You will play with the ```WASD keys``` and ```left control``` button to fire. The same schema as the left side applies to the movement control
